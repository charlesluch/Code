# this is a basic example of the three main activities of computer programming: input | processing | output

# This first line is provided for you

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
rate = input("Enter Rate:")
gp = float(hrs) * float(rate)
print('Pay:',gp)

# You should not include the input data in your source code. You must read the values for the rate and pay using input().

# Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25)
