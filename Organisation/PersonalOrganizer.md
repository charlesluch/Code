**ENERGY** through **HEALTH**, **PRACTICE** to become a *strong candidate* and *colleague*. **TOP QUALITY EFFORTS, everyday**

---

##### JUNE TASKS:

* Work to reality:
    * only solo projects are true CVs
    * only intensely collaborative projects can help you with observables & PM

* so:
    * BITS requires C, C++, C#, Java
    * you are doing PySpec & ML currently
    * you will do:
        * [Coursera's web dev spec](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-applications)
        * OO: C++ and Java

* Rather than getting stopped at the people phase, sort people, then Tech as a PM and a person, but Tech --> People as a technologist (both perspectives are important!)

* More communication practice: more out in the community delivering concise and clear messages, practice and refer back to your framework, do all the work in your mind: remember names, wake up wit and enthusiasm.

* never stop learning and practicing!

---

##### The man with a plan proposal:

* **Take the wheel**: make smart decisions about your career, your life direction, your relationships,
	* This takes effort - For example, it is your responsibility:
		* to communicate with Anna about the sale price of her car (communication),
		* to organize to pull out the Pug Speaker system and sell them (cognitive load and organization),
		* to say no to chasing bad investments with good money (smart decisions).
* *Money*:
		* Your debt to Anna is Anna's
		* Your smart financial choice is to invest in Brisbane's housing market now and not to lose the advantage of the relationship with Granny's stock brokers
		* Your smart insurance choice is to make a joint account "fund for a rainy day" that will be contributed to at the tune of $450 a month, any balance over $10k goes to a managed fund
* *Approach*:
		* quick plans
		* one thing at a time only
		* 15 minutes early is on-time
		* achieve schedule-billing correlation
		* pre-deadlines
		* bum on seat and move fast
	* *My responsibilities*:
		* 2 Job applications a day,
		* All food and housework,
		* Work like you HD 3 units each week, 40 hours billed,
			* Only with evidence of 40 hours billed can you even consider negotiating hackathons, PD after hours or seek any extra work time over-and-above meetings with Anna and yourself
        * spend some time adjusting your attitude
        	* the dark "It's all my fault/on me to fix" complex leads you only to self-harm and stress, reduces your IQ by 20 points, it's not welcome.
        	* plan, headspace, set realistic boundaries at home and at work.
		* *Sunday is plan day*:
			* *Responsibilities list*: meals | housework | 40 hours of schedule in 7:30-5 * 5 | 14 jobs queued (2nd job and Grad Role) | first 7 words for difficult negotiations in the week.
		* Find a house to buy in Brisbane with a $60k max deposit from you.
    * *My commitments*:
		* Stick the landing wherever you go (full dev. & data analytics skill-set, a consistent full-time worker and communicator),
		* Brisbane is your home, if you have to leave, minimize your time away,
		* Become financially self-sufficient sooner than Feburary 5, 2019.
    * *My dreams*:
		* build robots and games for your kids, nephews and Addies,
        * hold your own in a jam session with a great sounding horn (mk6?),
        * do the same at work with your teams, except your voice and mind are the horn,
        * feel the benefits of exercising regularly and courteously,
        * adventure based on your own heart-felt need for it.

* 08/05/18 Tuesday, Week 11:
    * You are okay, your problem is that you can't hold on to joy, that you don't cherish it and recognize its importance. That you can't see the long view on life, that you do not enforce strict boundaries and it burns you out... The only way you keep what's really of value is if you cherish and maintain it.
    * *time use report*
        * **CBB**: 12:30 for one set of dishes, YouTube portal and 1/2 a laundry load
        * **GOOD**: stopped, focused, did laundry, dishes to completion, ran, did the minutes and wrote the email to Lisa, M05/05 (3).

    * *improve*: **active living** - you dictate life, you engage with it and all its difficulties and challenges, you interact with it and negotiate the paths before you in line with your values. balance self-soothing with agency, by externalizing and giving up you surrender agency. Media doesn't enslave you, you learn philosophical messages from or dismiss media.

            * *PO is great*, but **only by doing do we learn**
        1. Take meds, brush and shower,
        1. Move fast and get some exercise in,

    * **Deadline Missed** Lab 8 not completed and submitted by close of business today.
    * *Improve*:
        1. *Next up*: 7 hrs sleep and catch up tomorrow: you complete all study for python scripting up to lab 8 including all exercises and then you start BISIP before work.
        1. don't let frustration lead you to procrastinate (1-2hrs today): you have a framework now. Run with it.

##### Professional and Social

* *Goal*: Learn to be comfortable and express yourself clearly and positively in company
    * **Current Focus**: Tall posture, unhurried pace, calm, confident face with slight, contented smile.
    * *7 Observables*: Appearance, Gestures, Facial Expressions, Posture, Voice, Movement, Energy.
    * *Craft the first 7 words*: after that you've lost people in the detail.
    * *The rule of 3+*:
        * ~~Me~~ (excuse to self-focus) ~~One~~ (no depth, only y/n)
        * open (who? what? when? where? how? why?) -> *expansive* (digging for gold) "tell me more..." "help me understand..." "walk me through..." "paint me a picture..."
        * the goal is to get to know someone well, with depth, and remember things (kids, partners, birthdays, key concerns)
        * notes taken on talking points (if professional).
        * end of conversation, if appropriate: "Did I get that right?" closed question to round out.
        * **Apply this to client interviews to make sure you get the absolute most out of your meetings!!**
    * Trust = [ Credibility() * Reliability() * Intimacy() ] / [ Self-Orientation() ]
        * Implications:
            1. Credibility and Reliability are largely defined by training, diligence and time management.
            1. Self-Orientation is what happens when you are not *engaged* in your work
            1. Intimacy (understanding a person, their concerns, their role, giving them a safe space) is what we can change,
