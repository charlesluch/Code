##### Day review:
###### (Done, In Progress, Next up, Obstacles, Deadlines, Improvement)

* 02/05/18 Wednesday, week 10:
    * *Next up*:
        * ~~write and submit Lab 8~~
        * Site build
        * Qld gov health job application
        * run and test doctest quickly before submitting Lab 9
        * Get going on Lab 10 and assignment 2 so you can clear the way for unadulterated scripting language study, BISIP contributions, job applications and project development.

* 01/05/18 Tuesday, week 10:
    * *Improved on*: did not go to procrastination straight up despite urge
    * *Improve*:
        1. Continue to resist the urge, go for fewer minutes dithering and an even quicker start on your set tasks:
            * **G**: 30 mins max on initial PO (now that it is settled, you can just touch on your focus points and go on with your priority task).
            * *PO is great*, but **only by doing do we learn**
        1. Take meds, brush and shower,
        1. Move fast and get some exercise in,

* 30/04/18 Monday, week 10:
    * *Done*: Sorted git and workflow, can now edit and run python
    * *In Progress*: started to review python notes in SLP subject
    * *Obstacle*: for some reason my code does not run in Atom, even with the help of the package I installed to allow me to run them.
    * **Deadline Missed** Lab 8 not completed and submitted by close of business today.
    * *Improve*:
        1. *Next up*: 7 hrs sleep and catch up tomorrow: you complete all study for python scripting up to lab 8 including all exercises and then you start BISIP before work.
        1. don't let frustration lead you to procrastinate (1-2hrs today): you have a framework now. Run with it.

##### Professional and Social

* *Goal*: Learn to be comfortable and express yourself clearly and positively in company
    * **Current Focus**: Tall posture, unhurried pace, calm, confident face with slight, contented smile.
    * *7 Observables*: Appearance, Gestures, Facial Expressions, Posture, Voice, Movement, Energy.
    * *Craft the first 7 words*: after that you've lost people in the detail.
    * *The rule of 3+*:
        * ~~Me~~ (excuse to self-focus) ~~One~~ (no depth, only y/n)
        * open (who? what? when? where? how? why?) -> *expansive* (digging for gold) "tell me more..." "help me understand..." "walk me through..." "paint me a picture..."
        * the goal is to get to know someone well, with depth, and remember things (kids, partners, birthdays, key concerns)
        * notes taken on talking points (if professional).
        * end of conversation, if appropriate: "Did I get that right?" closed question to round out.
        * **Apply this to client interviews to make sure you get the absolute most out of your meetings!!**
    * Trust = [ Credibility() * Reliability() * Intimacy() ] / [ Self-Orientation() ]
        * Implications:
            1. Credibility and Reliability are largely defined by training, diligence and time management.
            1. Self-Orientation is what happens when you are not *engaged* in your work
            1. Intimacy (understanding a person, their concerns, their role, giving them a safe space) is what we can change,
