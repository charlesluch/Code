* 08/05/18 Tuesday, Week 11:
    * You are okay, your problem is that you can't hold on to joy, that you don't cherish it and recognize its importance. That you can't see the long view on life, that you do not enforce strict boundaries and it burns you out... The only way you keep what's really of value is if you cherish and maintain it.
    * *time use report*
        * **CBB**: 12:30 for one set of dishes, YouTube portal and 1/2 a laundry load
        * **GOOD**: stopped, focused, did laundry, dishes to completion, ran, did the minutes and wrote the email to Lisa, M05/05 (3).

        * get status on tasks, write journal
        * Scripting Ax
        * DXC
    * *improve*: **active living** - you dictate life, you engage with it and all its difficulties and challenges, you interact with it and negotiate the paths before you in line with your values. balance self-soothing with agency, by externalizing and giving up you surrender agency. Media doesn't enslave you, you learn philosophical messages from or dismiss media.

##### Professional and Social

* *Goal*: Learn to be comfortable and express yourself clearly and positively in company
    * **Current Focus**: Tall posture, unhurried pace, calm, confident face with slight, contented smile.
    * *7 Observables*: Appearance, Gestures, Facial Expressions, Posture, Voice, Movement, Energy.
    * *Craft the first 7 words*: after that you've lost people in the detail.
    * *The rule of 3+*:
        * ~~Me~~ (excuse to self-focus) ~~One~~ (no depth, only y/n)
        * open (who? what? when? where? how? why?) -> *expansive* (digging for gold) "tell me more..." "help me understand..." "walk me through..." "paint me a picture..."
        * the goal is to get to know someone well, with depth, and remember things (kids, partners, birthdays, key concerns)
        * notes taken on talking points (if professional).
        * end of conversation, if appropriate: "Did I get that right?" closed question to round out.
        * **Apply this to client interviews to make sure you get the absolute most out of your meetings!!**
    * Trust = [ Credibility() * Reliability() * Intimacy() ] / [ Self-Orientation() ]
        * Implications:
            1. Credibility and Reliability are largely defined by training, diligence and time management.
            1. Self-Orientation is what happens when you are not *engaged* in your work
            1. Intimacy (understanding a person, their concerns, their role, giving them a safe space) is what we can change,
