##### To Sort

##### The man with a plan proposal:

* **Take the wheel**: make smart decisions about your career, your life direction, your relationships,
	* This takes effort - For example, it is your responsibility:
		* to communicate with Anna about the sale price of her car (communication),
		* to organize to pull out the Pug Speaker system and sell them (cognitive load and organization),
		* to say no to chasing bad investments with good money (smart decisions).
* *Money*:
		* Your debt to Anna is Anna's
		* Your smart financial choice is to invest in Brisbane's housing market now and not to lose the advantage of the relationship with Granny's stock brokers
		* Your smart insurance choice is to make a joint account "fund for a rainy day" that will be contributed to at the tune of $450 a month, any balance over $10k goes to a managed fund
* *Approach*:
		* quick plans
		* one thing at a time only
		* 15 minutes early is on-time
		* achieve schedule-billing correlation
		* pre-deadlines
		* bum on seat and move fast
	* *My responsibilities*:
		* 2 Job applications a day,
		* All food and housework,
		* Work like you HD 3 units each week, 40 hours billed,
			* Only with evidence of 40 hours billed can you even consider negotiating hackathons, PD after hours or seek any extra work time over-and-above meetings with Anna and yourself
        * spend some time adjusting your attitude
        	* the dark "It's all my fault/on me to fix" complex leads you only to self-harm and stress, reduces your IQ by 20 points, it's not welcome.
        	* plan, headspace, set realistic boundaries at home and at work.
		* *Sunday is plan day*:
			* *Responsibilities list*: meals | housework | 40 hours of schedule in 7:30-5 * 5 | 14 jobs queued (2nd job and Grad Role) | first 7 words for difficult negotiations in the week.
		* Find a house to buy in Brisbane with a $60k max deposit from you.
    * *My commitments*:
		* Stick the landing wherever you go (full dev. & data analytics skill-set, a consistent full-time worker and communicator),
		* Brisbane is your home, if you have to leave, minimize your time away,
		* Become financially self-sufficient sooner than Feburary 5, 2019.
    * *My dreams*:
		* build robots and games for your kids, nephews and Addies,
        * hold your own in a jam session with a great sounding horn (mk6?),
        * do the same at work with your teams, except your voice and mind are the horn,
        * feel the benefits of exercising regularly and courteously,
        * adventure based on your own heart-felt need for it.

##### Field QL feedback

Observations:
	1. A competitor to Kira Systems is better, starts with R... not REDDA.
	1. Basic Javascript Questions not answered in a way suggesting you have consolidated anything more than an introductory understanding of it.
    1. Passing by value and reference in JS
	1. Understand these terms and their application: FIELD,...,... // Position: absolute
	1. Handling Accenture Job offer noticably disrupted the flow of the final stages of the meeting, practice contraversial messages in future. First 7 words.
	1. Nervous, irrelevent words: Get better at getting to the point. Leave conversational stuff to the end so the interviewer does not feel time pressure. Practice effective communication.
	1. Great knowledge of SQL, Feel that way about all language types and also object oriented programming.

Now do this:
	1. JS
	2. OO
	3. Develop projects autonomously
	4. More communication practice, more out in the community delivering concise and clear messages, practice and refer back to your framework, do all the work in your mind: remember names, wake up wit and enthusiasm.
	5. Rather than getting stopped at the people phase, sort people, then Tech as a PM and a person, but Tech --> People as a technologist (both perspectives are important!)
	6. 2nd formal suit, shoes,cuffs...

When C looking like fail, why didn't you withdraw?
XP

After C fail, why didn't you get more prog xp before starting another prog subject?
Inefficiency + workload

Why didn't you work very hard once Perl came back as a fail?

Imperative (Inefficiency + workload), since dropped inefficient practices, choose everyday to keep working hard and smart to ensure I acheive my future goals and that I work effectively in pursuing my goals in future.
...
Okay then, keep going, be sure to make the changes to efficiency, work habits and attitudes now.
