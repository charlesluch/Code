##### Day review:
###### (Done, In Progress, Next up, Obstacles, Deadlines, Improvement)



* 08/05/18 Tuesday, Week 11:
    * You are okay, your problem is that you can't hold on to joy, that you don't cherish it and recognize its importance. That you can't see the long view on life, that you do not enforce strict boundaries and it burns you out... The only way you keep what's really of value is if you cherish and maintain it.
    * *time use report*
        * **CBB**: 12:30 for one set of dishes, YouTube portal and 1/2 a laundry load
        * **GOOD**: stopped, focused, did laundry, dishes to completion, ran, did the minutes and wrote the email to Lisa, M05/05 (3).
    * *next up*
        * dinner
        * minutes and status update email to Lisa
        * Run
        * get status on tasks, write journal
        * Scripting Ax
        * DXC
    * *improve*: **active living** - you dictate life, you engage with it and all its difficulties and challenges, you interact with it and negotiate the paths before you in line with your values. balance self-soothing with agency, by externalizing and giving up you surrender agency. Media doesn't enslave you, you learn philosophical messages from or dismiss media.

        * Beyond turning up, you must be smart, *hone your practice*, arrange time well and start getting *a little better each day* compared to (the comparable) yesterday at time management and task completion.
        * today is a full day of time, you lucky bastard!!
        * **Half** went to kindle, Handmaid's Tale, K.c and your own dick. Not a problem if you're on holiday, it is an indulgence you can't afford today, you will displace other, more important things...

    * *Improved on*: did not go to procrastination straight up despite urge
    * *Improve*:
        1. Continue to resist the urge, go for fewer minutes dithering and an even quicker start on your set tasks:
            * **G**: 30 mins max on initial PO (now that it is settled, you can just touch on your focus points and go on with your priority task).
            * *PO is great*, but **only by doing do we learn**
        1. Take meds, brush and shower,
        1. Move fast and get some exercise in,

* 30/04/18 Monday, week 10:
    * *Done*: Sorted git and workflow, can now edit and run python
    * *In Progress*: started to review python notes in SLP subject
    * *Obstacle*: for some reason my code does not run in Atom, even with the help of the package I installed to allow me to run them.
    * **Deadline Missed** Lab 8 not completed and submitted by close of business today.
    * *Improve*:
        1. *Next up*: 7 hrs sleep and catch up tomorrow: you complete all study for python scripting up to lab 8 including all exercises and then you start BISIP before work.
        1. don't let frustration lead you to procrastinate (1-2hrs today): you have a framework now. Run with it.

##### Professional and Social

* *Goal*: Learn to be comfortable and express yourself clearly and positively in company
    * **Current Focus**: Tall posture, unhurried pace, calm, confident face with slight, contented smile.
    * *7 Observables*: Appearance, Gestures, Facial Expressions, Posture, Voice, Movement, Energy.
    * *Craft the first 7 words*: after that you've lost people in the detail.
    * *The rule of 3+*:
        * ~~Me~~ (excuse to self-focus) ~~One~~ (no depth, only y/n)
        * open (who? what? when? where? how? why?) -> *expansive* (digging for gold) "tell me more..." "help me understand..." "walk me through..." "paint me a picture..."
        * the goal is to get to know someone well, with depth, and remember things (kids, partners, birthdays, key concerns)
        * notes taken on talking points (if professional).
        * end of conversation, if appropriate: "Did I get that right?" closed question to round out.
        * **Apply this to client interviews to make sure you get the absolute most out of your meetings!!**
    * Trust = [ Credibility() * Reliability() * Intimacy() ] / [ Self-Orientation() ]
        * Implications:
            1. Credibility and Reliability are largely defined by training, diligence and time management.
            1. Self-Orientation is what happens when you are not *engaged* in your work
            1. Intimacy (understanding a person, their concerns, their role, giving them a safe space) is what we can change,
