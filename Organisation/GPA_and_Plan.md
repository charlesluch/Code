# GPA and Learning Plan

Uni was chaotic and you often did not manage well, however, you have found a way to start doing focused, professional work with great teams .

##### Current subject result goals

SLP `13.2 =  + 3.2 // 16.8 + 10 = 26.8`
6% to go in Lx, *aim for 5*, 20% in A2, *aim for 15* 50% in exam *aim for 30*
Result = `10 + 3.2 + 4 + 10 + 25 = 52.2`

#### GPA Calculations

Total grade points divided by the total credit points = Grade Point Average.

`(12.5*points) / (12.5*units)`

###### Before Accenture

`GPA = (21*12.5) / (9*12.5) = 21/9 = 2.33`
`7pt = 21 + (9*3) / 9 = (21 + 27) / 9 = 48 / 9 = 5.3`

###### My current (4 point scale) GPA

`GPA = (35*12.5) / (19*12.5) = 35/19 = 1.84`
`7pt = 35 + (19*3) / 19 = (35 + 57) / 19 = 92 / 19 = 4.84`

###### Projected GPA

revise based on new plan to complete last level 3 Swinburne and 2 level 1 RMIT subjects while I work on my portfolio of projects.

`GPA = (43*12.5) / (22*12.5) = 43/22 = 1.95`
`7pt = 43 + (22*3) / 22 = (43 + 66) / 22 = 101 / 22 = 4.95`

*to stay above a credit average overall I must D every remaining subject*: credits get me 41/22 or 1.86.

##### Split by university and subject matter - Systems v Development

RMIT `GPA4 = 4+4+1+0+0(=9)/(5) = 1.8`
     `GPA7 = 9 + (3*5) / 5 = (9 + 15) / 5 = 24 / 5 = 4.8`
     
SWIN `GPA4 = 2+1+1+2+2+3+2+1+1+2+2+3+2+2(=27)/(14) = 1.92`
     `GPA7 = 27 + (14*3) / 14 = 27 + 42 / 14 = 69 / 14 = 4.92`

#### Avenues for further Professional Development post-degree

**To Do** - if there is a legitimate business case for learning this stuff, find a Coursera/MIT course and a colleague who works in the area that you can bounce questions off over coffee/lunch.

##### Professional Development Plan

* What:
    * Coursera (links page)
    * Existing course notes
    *
