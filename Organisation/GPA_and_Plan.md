# GPA and Learning Plan

Uni was chaotic and you often did not manage well, however, you have found a way to start doing focused, professional work with great teams .

##### Current subject result goals

SLP `13.2 =  + 3.2 // 16.8 + 10 = 26.8`
6% to go in Lx, *aim for 5*, 20% in A2, *aim for 15* 50% in exam *aim for 30*
Result = `10 + 3.2 + 4 + 10 + 25 = 52.2`

#### GPA Calculations

Total grade points divided by the total credit points = Grade Point Average.

`(12.5*points) / (12.5*units)`

###### Before Accenture

`GPA = (21*12.5) / (9*12.5) = 21/9 = 2.33`

###### My current (4 point scale) GPA

`GPA = (33*12.5) / (17*12.5) = 33/17 = 1.94`

###### Projected GPA

revise based on new plan to complete last level 3 Swinburne and 2 level 1 RMIT subjects while I work on my portfolio of projects.

`GPA = (46*12.5) / (22*12.5) = 46/22 = 2.09`

*to stay above a credit average I have to score within 2 points of my projection.*: I can pass INF30003 and CPT251 for instance, but I must maintain Ds in CPT230, CPT111, and score at least a D in my current INF30027.

#### Avenues for further Professional Development post-degree

**To Do** - if there is a legitimate business case for learning this stuff, find a Coursera/MIT course and a colleague who works in the area that you can bounce questions off over coffee/lunch.

##### Professional Development Plan

* What:
    * Coursera (links page)
    * Existing course notes
