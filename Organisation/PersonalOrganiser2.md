* Replace timewasting with a checklist and review:
    * If success, then reward.

##### Day review:
###### (Done, In Progress, Next up, Obstacles, Deadlines, Improvement)

* 01/05/18 Tuesday, week 10:
    * *Improved on*: did not go to procrastination straight up despite urge
    * *Improve*:
        1. Continue to resist the urge, go for fewer minutes dithering and an even quicker start on your set tasks:
            * **G**: 30 mins max on initial PO (now that it is settled, you can just touch on your focus points and go on with your priority task).
        1. Take meds, brush and shower,
        1. Move fast and get some exercise in,

* 30/04/18 Monday, week 10:
    * *Done*: Sorted git and workflow, can now edit and run python
    * *In Progress*: started to review python notes in SLP subject
    * *Obstacle*: for some reason my code does not run in Atom, even with the help of the package I installed to allow me to run them.
    * **Deadline Missed** Lab 8 not completed and submitted by close of business today.
    * *Improve*:
        1. *Next up*: 7 hrs sleep and catch up tomorrow: you complete all study for python scripting up to lab 8 including all exercises and then you start BISIP before work.
        1. don't let frustration lead you to procrastinate (1-2hrs today): you have a framework now. Run with it.

##### Professional and Social

* *Goal*: Learn to be comfortable and express yourself clearly and positively in company
    * **Current Focus**: Tall posture, unhurried pace, calm, confident face with slight, contented smile.
    * *7 Observables*: Appearance, Gestures, Facial Expressions, Posture, Voice, Movement, Energy.
    * *Craft the first 7 words*: after that you've lost people in the detail.
    * *The rule of 3+*:
        * ~~Me~~ (excuse to self-focus) ~~One~~ (no depth, only y/n)
        * open (who? what? when? where? how? why?) -> *expansive* (digging for gold) "tell me more..." "help me understand..." "walk me through..." "paint me a picture..."
        * the goal is to get to know someone well, with depth, and remember things (kids, partners, birthdays, key concerns)
        * notes taken on talking points (if professional).
        * end of conversation, if appropriate: "Did I get that right?" closed question to round out.
        * **Apply this to client interviews to make sure you get the absolute most out of your meetings!!**
    * Trust = [ Credibility() * Reliability() * Intimacy() ]
                         [ Self-Orientation ]
        * Implications:
            1. Credibility and Reliability are largely defined by training, diligence and time management.
            1. Self-Orientation is what happens when you are not *engaged* in your work
            1. Intimacy (understanding a person, their concerns, their role, giving them a safe space) is what we can change,
